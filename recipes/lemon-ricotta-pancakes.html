		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>¾ (184g) cup cold water or milk</li>
			<li>½ (2g) teaspoon baking soda</li>
			<li>½ (126p) cup ricotta cheese</li>
			<li>1 (6p) tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
			<li>1 (15ml) tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1 (12) tablespoon white sugar</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>⅛ (1ml) teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
			<li>2 (28g) tablespoons melted butter</li>
			<li>1 (15ml) tablespoon lemon juice</li>
			<li>1 (120g) cup self-rising flour</li>
			<li>2 (14g) tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta
				cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk
				until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter,
				lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together,
				stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
				Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When
				bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to
				look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through,
				2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.
