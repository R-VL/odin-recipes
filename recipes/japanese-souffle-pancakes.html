		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp (14 g) whole milk </li>
      <li>1 tsp (3 g) vanilla extract</li>
      <li>¼ cup (30 g) cake flour</li>
      <li>¾ tsp (3 g) baking powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp (1 g) fine sea salt</li>
      <li>2 ⅕ Tbsp (35 g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Whipped cream</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Maple Syrup</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
      <li>Start by cracking the eggs into a medium bowl and separate them into two separate bowls. One for the yolks, and one for the whites.</li>
      <li>To the yolks, add in whole milk, vanilla extract, and whisk together. Sift in cake flour, baking powder, and fine sea salt. Whisk to combine.</li>
      <li>Separately begin beating the egg whites with an electric beater. Once soft peaks form, slowly add in granulated sugar at a time until all is added. Beat until stiff peaks form.</li>
      <li>Fold in a ¼ of the meringue into the yolk mixture until fully incorporated.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process a quarter at a time until all of the meringue has been added. </li>
      <li>Transfer to a piping bag.</li>
      <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over low heat until hot. Spray with cooking oil and wipe off any excess. </li>
      <li>Pipe two evenly sized mounds along with a spoonful of water. Immediately cover and let steam, and cook for 5 minutes. </li>
      <li>Lift the lid and pipe another large mound on top of the two mounds. Add another spoonful of water, cover, and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes. </li>
      <li>Carefully roll/flip the pancake, add another spoonful of water, and cover. Cook for 3-4 minutes. </li>
      <li>Remove from the pan, and add to a plate. Top with whipped cream, butter, and a generous dusting of powdered sugar.
